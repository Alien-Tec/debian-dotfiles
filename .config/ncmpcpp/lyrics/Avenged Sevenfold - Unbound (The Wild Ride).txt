Somewhere life is good, and things go as they should
It′s hard to find, but that's alright yeah-e-yeah
Searching for the way, push harder everydayIt′s deep inside, that shining light yeah-e-yeah
But I'm scarred, by barriers placed in my path
I'm scathed

This ride that takes me through life
Leads me into darkness but emerges into light
No one can ever slow me down
I′ll stay unbound

Sometimes when we′re young, and always on the run
It gets so dark and I know that place yeah-e-yeah
So don't be too concerned, you′ve got a lot to learn
Well so do I and we've got plenty of time yeah-e-yeah
Don′t fall off the track yet with so many races to go

Hold on
This ride that takes me through life
Leads me into darkness but emerges into light
No one can ever slow me down

I'll stay unbound

Some live so wrong, with what we do is each his own
But living in fear, endless shame for countless years

I never lived in fear I knew I′d die another day
I never viewed my life as something, slipping away
Some live so wrong, with what we do is each his own
But living in fear, endless shame for countless years

I never lived in fear I knew I'd die another day
I never viewed my life as something, slipping away

There's nothing here to take for granted
With each breath that we take
The hands of time strip youth from our bodies

And we fade
Memories remain
As time goes on
There′s nothing here to take for granted
With each breath that we take
The hands of time strip youth from our bodies
And we fade
Memories remain
As time goes on
