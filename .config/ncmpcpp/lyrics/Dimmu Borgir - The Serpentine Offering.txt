My descent is the story of everyman
I am hatred, darkness and despair
My descent is the story of everymanI am hatred, darkness and despair
Oh

Evoked and entertained through centuries
Wrathful and sullen, dormant still

The ferocity pervades everywhere
Waiting to be released at last
Hear my offering
Ye bastards, sons and daughters
Share my sacrifice
Share my sacrifice

My descent is the story of everyman
I am hatred, darkness and despair
My descent is the story of everyman
I am hatred, darkness and despair

Reconcile not with the fear of the snake
But embrace it as your own
Inject its venom into your veins
And replant the seed that gives growth
Still shrouded in mystery
Until you arise above perception
A veil of ignorance is in motion
Continuing throughout generations

(A veil of ignorance is in motion)
(Continuing throughout multiple generations)
(Let me be the one that delivers you from the deceit)
(And back into perfect accordance with the laws of nature)

The snake is notoriously tempting
But the snake is fair
What is worse than not knowing?
To live or disappear?

The ferocity pervades everywhere
Waiting to be released at last
Hear my offering
Ye bastards, sons and daughters
Share my sacrifice
Share my sacrifice
