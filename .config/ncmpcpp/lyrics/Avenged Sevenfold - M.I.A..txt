Staring at the carnage, praying that the sun would never rise
Living another day in disguise
These feelings can′t be rightLend me your courage to stand up and fight on tonight
Stand up and fight

The fighting rages on and on
To challenge me you must be strong
I walk your land but don't belong
Two million soldiers can′t be wrong
It's no fun but I've been here before
I′m far from home and I′m fighting your war
Not the way I pictured this, I wanted better things
Some are scared others killing for fun
I shot a mother right in front of her son
Take this from my consciousness and please erase my dreams

Fight for honor, fight for your life
Pray to God that our side is right
Though we won I still may lose
Until I make it home to you
I see our mothers filled with tears
Grew up so fast where did those years go?
Memories won't let you cry, unless I don′t return tonight

So many soldiers on the other side
I take their lives so they can't take mine
Scared to make it out alive, now murder′s all I know
Nobody tells me all the reasons we're here
I have my weapons so there′s nothing to fear
Another day, another life, but nothing real to show for

Fight for honor, fight for your life
Pray to God that our side is right
Though we won I still may lose
Until I make it home to you
I see our mothers filled with tears
Grew up so fast where did those years go?
Memories won't let you cry, unless I don't return tonight

Staring at the carnage, praying that the sun would never rise
Living another day in disguise
These feelings can′t be right
Lend me your courage to stand up and fight

Watching the death toll rise, wondering how I′m alive
Strangers' blood on my hands, I′ve shot all I can
There are no silent nights watching your brothers all die
To destroy all their plans with no thought of me (no thought of me)
No thought of me

I walk the city lonely, memories that haunt are passing by
A murderer walks your streets tonight
Forgive me for my crimes
Don't forget that I was so young, fought so scared
In the name of God and country
