A short man from Texas, a man of the wild
Thrown into combat, where bodies lie piled
Hides his emotions, his blood′s running coldJust like his victories, his story unfolds

Bright, a white light
If there'd be any glory in war
Let it rest on men like him
(Dead men will never come back)

Crosses grow on Anzio
Where no soldier sleeps and where hell′s six feet deep
That death does wait, there's no debate
So charge and attack, going to hell and back

A man of the 15th, a man of can do
Friends fall around him, and yet he came through
Let them fall face down if they must die
Making it easier to say goodbye

Bright, a white light
If there'd be any glory in war
Let it rest on men like him
Who went to hell and came back

Crosses grow on Anzio
Where no soldier sleeps and where hell′s six feet deep
That death does wait, there′s no debate
So charge and attack, going to hell and back

Oh, gather 'round me and listen while I speak
Of a war where hell is six feet deep
And all along the shore where cannons still roar
They′re haunting my dreams, they're still there when I sleep

He saw crosses grow on Anzio
Where no soldier sleeps and where hell′s six feet deep
That death does wait, there's no debate
He charged and attacked, he went to hell and back
